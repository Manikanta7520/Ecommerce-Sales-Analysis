## Project Overview
This project is part of Data Visualization.
The goal of this project is to perform a complete data analysis workflow, starting from loading and cleaning a real-world dataset to analyzing it and visualizing key insights.
The project uses Python, pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze an e-commerce sales dataset.
By combining numerical analysis with visualizations, the project demonstrates how data can be transformed into meaningful insights that support better understanding and decision-making.

## Project Objective
- Load and explore a real-world sales dataset  
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values and duplicates  
- Perform basic sales analysis  
- Create at least **two different types of charts**  
- Generate meaningful insights from the analysis  
- Present results with professional documentation

---

## Dataset Used
This dataset contains e-commerce sales information used for data analysis and visualization.
- Product – Name of the product sold
- Price – Price of a single unit
- Customer_ID – Unique identifier for each customer
- Region – Sales region
- Total_Sales – Total sales amount for each transaction


---

## Technologies / Tools Used
- List tools and libraries.
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Insights
- The analysis shows the overall sales performance by calculating total revenue from all transactions.
- The bar chart highlights that certain products contribute significantly more to total sales compared to others.
- Product-wise analysis helps identify top-performing products, which are key revenue drivers.
- The pie chart reveals that sales are not evenly distributed across regions, with some regions contributing a larger share of total sales.
- Visualizing sales data makes it easier to identify patterns and trends that are not immediately obvious from raw numbers.
- Combining numerical analysis with visualizations provides a clearer understanding of business performance and customer demand.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a complete data analysis and visualization workflow using Python.
By loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing e-commerce sales data, meaningful insights were extracted from raw data.
The use of bar and pie charts helped present complex sales information in a clear and understandable manner.
This project strengthened practical skills in data handling, analysis, and visualization using pandas and matplotlib.
Overall, the project provides a strong foundation in data analysis and prepares for more advanced data science and visualization tasks in the future.
